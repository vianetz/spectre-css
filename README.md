## Spectre.css (fork)

[![Reviewed by Hound](https://img.shields.io/badge/Reviewed_by-Hound-8E64B0.svg)](https://houndci.com)

Spectre.css is a lightweight, responsive and modern CSS framework.

- Lightweight (~10KB gzipped) starting point for your projects
- Flexbox-based, responsive and mobile-friendly layout
- Elegantly designed and developed elements and components

Spectre is a side project based on years of CSS development work on a large web service project. Spectre only includes modern base styles, responsive layout system, CSS components and utilities, and it can be modified for your project with Sass/Scss compiler.

## Purpose of this fork

As the original author unfortunately is [no longer responsive](https://github.com/picturepan2/spectre/issues/684) I started this fork of Spectre.css to continue development and update with latest browser versions.

My **main goal** for this fork is to keep the spirit of the excellent original work by the author, which means
- keep it extremely lightweight and simple
- stay up-to-date with latest browser developments

Of course I'm happy to accept pull requests for bugfix or feature proposals.

## Getting started

There are 4 ways to get started with Spectre CSS framework in your projects. You can either manually install or use NPM, Yarn and Bower.

## Browser support
Spectre uses [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) to make most styles compatible with earlier browsers and [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) for CSS resets. Spectre is designed for modern browsers. For best compatibility, these browsers are recommended:

- Chrome (LAST 4)
- Microsoft Edge (LAST 4)
- Firefox (EXTENDED SUPPORT RELEASE)
- Safari (LAST 4)
- Opera (LAST 4)
- Internet Explorer 10+

Spectre supports Internet Explorer 10+, but some HTML5 and CSS3 features are not perfectly supported by Internet Explorer.
